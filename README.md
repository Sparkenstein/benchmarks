# Node http frameworks benchmarks

 - First thing first, benchmarks are stupid, never judge a framework by it's speed
 - Real life web applications are never just `app.get('/', return "hello world")` So These benchmarks are just for fun, real life speed with complex applications may vary


## Specs:

 - Fedora 28 on 4.18.18-200.fc28.x86_64 kernel
 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690 CPU @ 3.50GHz
 - Corsair 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM
 - Node version 11.1.0
 - wrk version 4.1.0
-------------

Note: Tests are done with following configuration:
```
$ wrk -c 120 -d 30 -t 4 [url]
```

Raw HTTP module is sure a beast! But it's hard to manage without a framework. I have taken it into consideration Just to compare native speed with other frameworks. Keeping it aside, looks like Polka wins the race here. But as I said, benchmarks are usually stupid and should be taken into consideration at `lowest` priority while deciding a framework.
